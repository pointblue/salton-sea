Here is the main bird dataset. It is basically a single Excel file that includes the raw point count data
2000-2012 provided in late 2014 by Tom Anderson of UFWS refuges, with each year a separate worksheet, and
summaries in some years. 

I'm including his email text so you see how I received it. Again, Kathy Molina has been a contractor on 
this, but I'm not even sure this dataset originated with her. I got it in Dec. 2014, and at that point, 
they didn't have anything past 2011 entered (= 3-year time-lag?).

I've appended a couple worksheets with historical->recent CBC data to the file, but I haven't touched the 
raw data from FWS. The two CBCs cover huge areas and obvious aren't standardized - the south end CBC 
includes the entire SE swath of the sea from Wister through Sonny Bono NWR down to Obsidian Bay and the 
New River mouth; the north end includes all the "presidents" road ends at the northeast (Grant, Cleveland, 
etc.) and the "80s" road ends on the northwest, plus Whitewater River mouth - PLUS all the off-sea wetland 
habitats at the north and south...(e.g., Finney-Ramer Lakes, etc.)

Look in my report for summaries of these databases; ultimately I found that with such a mass of data it 
needed to be culled down to most abundant species/spp groups, hence that what I included in the report.

Hi Dan,

So sorry for not getting back to you sooner.  We do have waterbird count data from 2012.  I have to say 
that this data set is not very good.  Throughout, there were a lot of staff changes and everyone seemed 
to have different skill levels and they also made protocol changes to suit their needs.  Most changes in 
personnel and methods were not well documented.  Survey points were dropped or added over the years and 
toward the end the data may not be as good because the birds were much farther away from the survey points.
Not much has been done with this data so far.  It was originally collected to inform us of species 
abundance and migration patterns with the intent of providing better response to avian disease outbreaks.  
There were a few focal species and many of the less common species often were overlooked.  I must caution 
you in what inferences you can draw from analysis because of the flaws in the data set.  
I've attached a spreadsheet of monthly totals by year.

Tom
